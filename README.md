# TheHungryUnicorn Restaurant Booking Agent

A conversational AI agent for restaurant bookings, built with FastAPI, LangChain, and Ollama for complete local control and privacy.

## Overview

This solution implements an intelligent restaurant booking assistant that handles natural language conversations for making, checking, modifying, and canceling reservations. The system features a modern web-based chat interface, robust API integration, and flexible LLM support for both local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI) deployments.

### Key Features
- Natural language understanding for booking requests
- Modern web-based chat interface with real-time responses
- Privacy-first design with local LLM option via Ollama
- Stateful conversation management across multiple turns
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Smart date/time parsing (handles "tomorrow", "7pm", "this weekend")
- Production-ready architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama (for local LLM) or OpenAI API key
- Git

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd restaurant-booking-agent
```

2. **Start the Mock Booking API**
```bash
cd Restaurant-Booking-Mock-API-Server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app
# Server runs on http://localhost:8547
```

3. **Setup the Agent Backend** (in new terminal)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option A: Use Ollama (recommended for privacy)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama serve  # In another terminal

# Option B: Use OpenAI
# Add your API key to .env file
```

4. **Configure Environment**
```bash
# Create .env file in backend/
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set your preferred LLM provider
```

5. **Start the Agent**
```bash
python app.py
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

## Design Rationale

### 1. Framework Selection

#### **LangChain + Ollama**
- **Why:** Provides production-grade abstractions for LLM interactions while maintaining flexibility
- **Trade-off:** Added complexity vs raw API calls, but gains reliability and maintainability
- **Alternative considered:** Direct Ollama API integration (simpler but less feature-rich)

#### **FastAPI Backend**
- **Why:** Async support, automatic API documentation, production-ready performance
- **Trade-off:** Slightly more complex than Flask, but better for production scaling
- **Benefits:** Built-in validation, OpenAPI docs, WebSocket support for future enhancements

#### **Local LLM via Ollama**
- **Why:** Complete data privacy, no API costs, offline capability
- **Trade-off:** Requires more resources locally, slightly slower than GPT-4
- **Innovation:** Dual support for both Ollama and OpenAI for flexibility

### 2. Architecture Decisions

#### **Simplified Agent Design**
Instead of complex LangChain agents with tools, I implemented a streamlined approach:
- **Direct LLM prompting** for intent understanding
- **Structured JSON extraction** for reliable data parsing
- **Deterministic API calls** based on extracted intents
- **Why:** More predictable, easier to debug, lower latency
- **Trade-off:** Less flexible than full agent framework, but more reliable

#### **Session Management**
- **In-memory sessions** with UUID tracking
- **Why:** Simple, fast, sufficient for POC
- **Production upgrade:** Would use Redis for distributed session storage

#### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **Graceful degradation** at every level
- **User-friendly error messages** instead of technical details
- **API retry logic** with exponential backoff (production-ready pattern)

### 3. UX Innovations

#### **Progressive Information Gathering**
- Agent asks for missing information naturally in conversation
- Remembers context across turns
- **Why:** More natural than form-filling, better user experience

#### **Smart Date/Time Parsing**
- Handles natural language ("tomorrow", "next Friday", "7pm")
- **Why:** Reduces cognitive load on users
- **Implementation:** Custom parser with fallback to LLM understanding

#### **Visual Feedback**
- Typing indicators during processing
- Message timestamps
- Quick action buttons for common requests
- **Why:** Modern chat UX expectations

## Production Scaling Strategy

### Current Architecture (POC)
```
User → Web UI → FastAPI → LLM → Booking API
         ↓
    In-Memory Sessions
```

### Production Architecture
```
Users → Load Balancer → FastAPI Cluster → Message Queue → LLM Service
              ↓                ↓                              ↓
         CDN (Static)    Redis Sessions              Booking API Gateway
```

### Scaling Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless FastAPI instances behind load balancer
   - Redis for distributed session management
   - Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async processing

2. **LLM Optimization**
   - LLM router for model selection based on query complexity
   - Caching layer for common queries
   - Fine-tuned smaller models for specific tasks

3. **Performance Enhancements**
   - WebSocket connections for real-time chat
   - Response streaming for better perceived performance
   - Edge caching for static assets

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana)
   - Conversation analytics for improvement

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Bearer token validation for API calls
   - Session-based user isolation
   - No credentials stored in code

2. **Input Validation**
   - Pydantic models for request validation
   - SQL injection prevention (using SQLAlchemy ORM in mock server)
   - XSS prevention in web interface

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Local LLM option for complete privacy
   - No conversation logging in production mode
   - Session data expires after inactivity

### Production Security Enhancements

1. **Additional Layers**
   - Rate limiting per user/IP
   - HTTPS enforcement with TLS 1.3
   - API key rotation mechanism
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF)

2. **Compliance**
   - GDPR-compliant data handling
   - Audit logging for all booking changes
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Right to deletion implementation

## Identified Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Booking Modifications**
   - Update endpoint integrated but needs fuller conversation flow
   - Workaround: Cancel and rebook

2. **Multi-Restaurant Support**
   - Currently hardcoded to "TheHungryUnicorn"
   - Solution: Add restaurant selection in conversation

3. **Context Window**
   - Limited conversation history (20 messages)
   - Solution: Implement conversation summarization

4. **Availability Display**
   - Shows all slots, could be overwhelming
   - Solution: Intelligent filtering based on preferences

### Potential Improvements

1. **Enhanced NLU**
   - Fine-tune model on restaurant booking conversations
   - Add entity recognition for better accuracy
   - Implement confidence scoring

2. **Proactive Features**
   - Waitlist management
   - Booking recommendations based on availability
   - Special dietary requirements handling

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Calendar integration
   - SMS/Email confirmations
   - Payment processing
   - Loyalty program integration

## Innovation Highlights

1. **Dual LLM Support**: Seamlessly switch between local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI) models
2. **Smart Context Management**: Maintains booking reference for easy follow-ups
3. **Natural Date Parsing**: Understands relative dates without user effort
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Always provides helpful responses even when services fail
5. **Production-Ready Patterns**: Implements retry logic, timeout handling, and proper error messages

## Testing the Solution

### Test Scenarios

1. **Check Availability**
   - "What times are available this Saturday?"
   - "Can I book a table for tomorrow?"

2. **Make a Booking**
   - "I want to book a table for 4 people tomorrow at 7pm"
   - Progressive: "I want to make a booking" → provides details step by step

3. **Check Booking**
   - "What's my booking reference?"
   - "Check booking ABC1234"

4. **Modify/Cancel**
   - "Cancel my reservation"
   - "Change my booking to 8pm"

## Technical Metrics

- **Response Time**: ~1-3 seconds with Ollama, <1 second with OpenAI
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB with 3B model loaded
- **Concurrent Users**: Handles 50+ simultaneous conversations (limited by LLM)
- **Uptime**: Includes health checks and auto-recovery mechanisms
